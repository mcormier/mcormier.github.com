During vacation this summer we visited a used bookstore in PEI.  My son found Frankenstein and asked if I could read it
to him.  This melted my heart, the fact that my son picked a book with no pictures and wanted me to read it to him made
me feel like I might actually being doing something right, raising a future reader.

I read it to my son but the vocabulary and more old-timey complex sentence structures were too much for him at his age.
He was very patient though and lasted about the first 30 pages before exclaiming "Dad, I don't understand what is going
on!!".  Oh well, now we have a copy for when he is older.

A month later I picked up the book and read it myself just in time for Halloween.  I found the structure of the book 
most interesting.  The narration is essentially Walton -> Frankenstein -> the Monster -> Frankentein -> Walton.  A story
within a story within a story, or a valley that you climb down and then climb out of.
