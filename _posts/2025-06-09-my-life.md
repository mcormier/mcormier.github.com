It took me twenty months to finish this book.  It was the definition of a slog for me.  Obviously I read other books during this time.  Between novels I would make myself read another 50 pages to get through it, but sometimes I would just pick up another piece of fiction after 20 pages.  I've read Mulroney and Obama's 1000 page tomes and they were a breeze and interesting compared to this monstrosity.

The most interesting part of this was him admitting to prank calling a brothel with his compatriots; the head madame getting angry that they were tying up the line.  Most of it is quite dull. It reads like a fluffed up name dropping rework of a reread of his agenda book.

 Not being American, and this being a bit before my time, the domestic policy stuff was not interesting to me.  How Ross Perot and Ralph Nader effected elections was interesting though, and some of the intricacies of the Israel/Palestine peace negotiations near the end of the book.
