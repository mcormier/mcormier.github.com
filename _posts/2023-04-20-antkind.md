Usually with a 700-page book I read it as fast as I can as I find the momentum brings the book alive. I could tell 100 
pages in that there wasn't the level of post-modern complexity ( lots of characters etc) that a sprint read was not 
necessary. Not only that, I felt that a slow read made it more savoury. It took me almost two months to read and my 
only regret is that I didn't take a full three months to read. ;)
