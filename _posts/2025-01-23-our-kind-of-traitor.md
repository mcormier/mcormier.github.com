Le Carré novels are quite often adapted for to the big screen.  His older novels, circa Tinker Tailor, Soldier, Spy were novels first and became movies later.  Chapters were 30+ pages with meaty paragraphs of description.  The Honourable SchoolBoy was considered a good book but was passed up for the big screen because it considered unfilmable.

Our Kind of Traitor is Le Carré’s twenty second novel and it seems to be a victim of his success.  It feels more like a novel that was written with the intention of being a movie.  At least that was my first impression of the novel.  I was not a fan of the first 200 pages which were cuts between an interrogation and past events.  I wrongly assumed that it was written this way so that it could be adapted for the screen in the same manner.  

Well this novel was adapted into a movie by Canal+, it’s currently free on Tubi if you want to watch it.  Have I told you how much I love Tubi?  And wasn’t I surprised to watch it and see how much the narrative structure was different.  A chronological narrative instead of a bifurcated interrogation.
