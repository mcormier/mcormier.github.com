I found out about this book because a female Mossad agent in The Little Drummer Girl reads it and this is mentioned 
several times. So when I found a used copy for $5 I picked it up.

Did I find this book absolutely enthralling? No. But it kept me reading and I liked that because it was a serial the 
chapters were short and I enjoyed reading it at a steady pace of only a chapter or two each day.

I can see why John Le Carr√© referenced the book. Henchard is a tragic character following a tragic path and many of his 
novels post Smiley's People are in the same vein.
