The first time I read this I was completely discombobulated from the experience and had no idea what I had just read. 
This was a decade ago, I was busy, busy, busy, living a modern life, working out too hard at the gym and trying to read 
this before I went to bed. I would never get through more than five pages before I fell asleep.

Reading this book at that slow a pace just didn't work as this is not pedestrian literature. It requires your attention. 
It breaks rules, like naming main characters with the same first letter: Pirate Prentice, Pointsman. It shifts the 
narrative without giving you warning. It introduces characters in the first 200 pages and doesn't mention them again
for 400 pages.

A decade later with some trepidation I decided to take on this book again. But I came armed with a slower lifestyle and 
less sleep debt. I also read it in conjunction to listening to the now defunct "Pynchon in Public" podcast. I would 
read my required chapters then listen to the podcast to get some interesting insights.

Another thing I did when reading this book was take breaks. The book is broken into four distinct sections:

1. Beyond the Zero page 1 - 177
2. Un Perm' au Casino Herman Goering 181 - 278
3. In the Zone 279 -616
4. The Counterforce 617-760

After reading each section I went and read a different book, and I found reading it in this manner quite enjoyable.
