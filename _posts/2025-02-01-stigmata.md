My second foray into the many worlds of Philip K Dick.  I did not enjoy this as much as The Man in the High Castle but that doesn’t mean it wasn’t enjoyable.  This book falls under the category of books that would be very difficult to adapt for film although I'm sure a master story teller could find a way.

I found it dissatisfying that precognition figured so prominently in the begining of the novel but faded away in the second half.  Maybe this was intentional, that using Chew-Z made precognition not possible as the characters never left the hallucination.  Maybe Dick rewrote the story and didn't have time to fix such a change in tone.  The book is definitely ambiguous.
