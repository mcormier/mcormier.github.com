Definitely a different experience. I would not recommend this to anyone I know. I picked up on circularness of the plot 
and a couple of other things. Read the plot summary on wikipedia to learn what I missed.

Long, banal and depressing. I started this and didn’t like the vibe. I took a vacation by the sea and didn’t want this 
to be my sunny read so took ten days off from reading this and read some more jovial summer reads.

So I read it slow at first but then powered through it to get it finished. This was a book that I read and kept with 
based on reputation so I could put a notch on my belt that I’ve read it.
