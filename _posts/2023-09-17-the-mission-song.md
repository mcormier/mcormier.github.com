I purchased a used paperback copy for the sum of six dollars. As soon as I started reading the novel something felt off. 
Eventually I figured out what was so odd about my reading experience. You see, over time, I have become accustomed to 
paperbacks of a certain size. 4 1/4 inches wide by 7 inches tall to be precise. But my copy of The Mission Song is much
taller measuring at 7 1/2 inches tall.

This slightly different form factor was mildly discombobulating though I persevered, and "got used to it".

As for the novel, I found the protagonist quite naïve, especially as the novel got closer and closer to the conclusion. 
Nothing in the novel surprised me but I might be getting too used to the Carré style as I have been reading his novels 
in pretty close to consecutive order.

Only six left to go and six of them are waiting patiently on my Tsundoku shelf ...
